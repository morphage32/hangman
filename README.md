Command Line Hangman Project

This mini-project involves working with data outside of the rb file itself. The text file used in this project is meant to have a word list that will be used to create a hangman puzzle based on a randomly selected line in the list.

The game will also include file writing and serialization features that will enable a player to save a game and quit out of the program. With this feature, the player can open the program and resume the game right where it was left off.
